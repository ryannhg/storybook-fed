### Need to add a tag to the head?

You can create a file in this folder called `preview-head.html` and add in any tags you want.

(And if you need to add in a `<script>` tag, add the `defer` attribute, so it runs after the content loads)

[More about that here](https://storybook.js.org/configurations/add-custom-head-tags)
